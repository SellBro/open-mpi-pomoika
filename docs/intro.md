# Open MPI General 

The **Open MPI Project** is an open source **[Message Passing Interface](http://www.mpi-forum.org/)** implementation that is developed and maintained by a consortium of academic, research, and industry partners. Open MPI is therefore able to combine the expertise, technologies, and resources from all across the High Performance Computing community in order to build the best MPI library available. Open MPI offers advantages for system and software vendors, application developers and computer science researchers.

## Getting Started

Open MPI is an open source implementation of MPI (message-passing interface), the industry-standard specification for writing message-passing programs. Message passing is a programming model that gives the programmer explicit control over interprocess communication.

The MPI specification was developed by the MPI Forum, a group of software developers, computer vendors, academics, and computer-science researchers whose goal was to develop a standard for writing message-passing programs that would be efficient, flexible, and portable.
